## Resources & Permissions

### Understanding the access control matrix

- Each row is inclusive of the permission qualifiers of rows below it. 

	_Example:_
	
	|   | List | View | Create | Update | Delete |
	|---|------|------|--------|--------|--------|
	| **Superadmin/admin** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  ✓ |
	| **Event organizer** | ✓ <sup>[1]</sup> | ✓ <sup>[1]</sup> | ✓ <sup>[1]</sup> | ✓ <sup>[1]</sup> | ✓ <sup>[1]</sup> |
	| **Everyone else** | ✓ <sup>[2]</sup> | ✓ <sup>[2]</sup>  |  | |  |
	
	1. Only self-owned events
	2. Only of events with state `published`
	
	
	Here,
	
	- **Event organizer** can list the resources of **self-owned events** and **other events with with state `published`**.
	- **Everyone else** can view resources of **other events with with state `published`**.
	- **Superadmin/admin** can do both of the above.

- Multiple permission qualifiers used together represt an `AND` operation.
	
	_Example:_
	
	Consider the following qualifiers,
	1. Only of sessions with state `approved` or `accepted`
	2. Only to events with state `published`.

	When used together as `[1][2]`, it means, **Only of sessions with state `approved` or `accepted` those belong to events with state `published`**.

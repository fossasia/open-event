	"description": "At Red Hat Summit 2017 we celebrated the individuals, the explorers, the builders. We celebrated the unsung hero of the server room, the doer who keeps the lights on and the enterprise running. We spotlighted the explorer, the dreamer who boldly offers a new solution to an old problem we just couldn’t seem to overcome. For open source innovation is only possible because of the people behind it. Don’t miss a thing as we prepare for next year’s event.",

He has been involved with OpenStack and Ceph since 2011 and has built a strong expertise around them. Curious and passionate, he loves working on bleeding edge technologies and identifying opportunities where OpenStack and Ceph can enhance the user experience. In 2013, he began working with containers as well and ultimately implemented containerized Docker Ceph services. Now on a daily basis, he rotates between Ceph, OpenStack, and Docker in an effort to strengthen the integration between all three. From time to time, he attends various events where he evangelizes these technologies and their usage, while devoting his copious spare time to blogging. See http://www.sebastien-han.fr/blog/. But alas, this is just the beginning.",

Spatial analysis includes a variety of techniques, many still in their early development, using different analytic approaches and applied in fields as diverse as astronomy, with its studies of the placement of galaxies in the cosmos, to chip fabrication engineering, with its use of \"place and route\" algorithms to build complex wiring structures. In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of geographic data.  Complex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied.  Classification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take.",

        "long-biography": "I have a strong passion in dealing problems in an efficient way. No matter how much time it takes, I like to try things to benefit the society.  I am willing to devote myself to spend thousands of hours to help others save an hour for their work. I believe the environment must be changed to make it a better world for us to do things effectively. Apart from the efficiency, I am interested in joining a community because it gives me an opportunity to acquire both determination and selflessness. Working together in the community makes me feel a part of something bigger; it teaches me not to only make decision from my perspective view but to take the whole community into consideration. Although practicing coding takes sweat, I am still willing to devote myself to help others finish the projects. Not until I overcome one failure after another can I learn that the turning points are meant to trigger your potential ability. Every obstacle happened in community is a chance for me to cultivate skills and enhance competitiveness.  As the two main points mentioned above, with the ambition to challenge myself and to venture into the unknown, I would like to grab the chance to join FOSSASIA 2016. To wake myself up under the sleepy eyes of ignoring the cruel facts of the world, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to be stimulated by the diversity. To gain more information and get to know more people, it is a great opportunity for me to face challenges and receive suggestions. I know I am still lack for experience and knowledge, so I hope, by joining FOSSASIA 2016, I can get more inspiration and innovation to make my project even better.  And...  One reason why I want to attend this program is because of my ambition for promoting the open source software. I am a sophomore at Cheng Kung University in Tainan the southern city in Taiwan. I am usually buried under a heavy load of homework during the week. So I usually try to take an adventure to try new software programs for making my work more convenient. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTechnology happens when imagination meets need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With the development of the technology, I can use open sources, such as Inkscape, Amara and Gimp online. One of the most terrifying assignment that I have ever had)was assigned by Professor Yung for the course \u00e2\u0080\u009celectrical circuit\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We had to read through papers about the electricity and find out what we can probe from our class materials, like noise filters or common base amplifiers. Moreover, I had to make an English presentation to give my proposal in this class.  So when I finally have some free time on weekends, I can surf the internet to check out the latest information for open source. I easily use Inskape to redesign picture forms Openclipart to make eye-popping slides. Also as a English learner, I use Amara to translate video like Emma Watson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech in the EU from youtube. From this, I practice not only my listening skills, but also how to boost my impact of my communication in English. Simply put, I want to deliver the convince which I gain from the open source software. Open source software has changed the way I see my world, and now I want it to change the world that I see and live in.",

My Contribution: I was selected as Google Summer Code 2015 Student for KDE Org. I worked on the project LabPlot, where I integrated another application Cantor[1] into LabPlot[2]. LabPlot is a scientific data plotter application while Cantor is a front-end to powerful mathematics and statistics package. Data sources in LabPlot originate from a spreadsheet where the user types in the data by hand or import the data from an external ASCII-file to a spreadsheet. So, I integrated the worksheet capability of Cantors and extensibility to work on various back-ends such as Maxima, Octave, Python 2 and 3, R, Sage etc. to LabPlot. Now user can use those back-ends to create a worksheet inside of LabPlot and then export data from these worksheets to Plot and do a lot more with graphs than what Cantor offered before. Refer to my blog[1] for a detailed example. I have also been associated with KDE before GSOC 2015, I contributed in porting various KDE Applications to new KDE Frameworks 5 including LabPlot.

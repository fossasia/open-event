In 1988, Miller founded the field of fuzz random software testing—the foundation of many security and software engineering disciplines. In 1992, Miller (working with his then-student Jeffrey Hollingsworth), founded the field of dynamic binary code instrumentation and coined the term “dynamic instrumentation,” which forms the basis for his current efforts in malware analysis and instrumentation. His research interests include systems security, binary and malicious code analysis and instrumentation of extreme-scale systems, parallel and distributed program measurement and debugging, and mobile computing.

Wouldn't it be nice if this was easier? This session will cover a new approach to lifecycles and explore functionality that makes the problem dramatically easier. Be sure to also check out the other two 'Architecture Components' sessions for more information on architecting better Android applications.</p>",

This session will cover a new approach that allows you to architect your persistence layer in a much more robust and scalable way, benefiting from the full power of SQL without sacrificing compile-time code guarantees. We'll also discuss approaches and features that make offline persistence easier.
